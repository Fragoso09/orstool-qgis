The Isochrone algorithm returns service/reachability areas for multiple locations and time/distance ranges.

You need to have a valid API key ('Web' menu ► 'ORS Tools' ► 'Configuration') or sign up at https://openrouteservice.org/sign-up/.

As Geometry Input, you can choose between Point from map or Point Layer, which are mutually exclusive options (if a layer is specified it'll be used in any case). For Start layers, only Point layers are allowed, NOT MultiPoint.

The ID field can be used to join the input layer afterwards.

The ranges parameter needs to be a comma-separated list of integer values, no decimal points. Current restriction limits apply, see https://openrouteservice.org/restrictions/.

The output layer is a Polygon layer with ID, range value, travel mode and total population (from GHSL). The CRS is EPSG:4326.
